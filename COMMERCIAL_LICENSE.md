# Commercial Licensing

MeetScribe is available under a dual-licensing model:

- Commercial license: proprietary terms for organizations that need to use MeetScribe without AGPL obligations

## Why a commercial license?

A commercial license is intended for organizations that need one or more of the following:

- use MeetScribe in proprietary products or internal closed-source platforms;
- modify MeetScribe and keep those modifications private;
- distribute MeetScribe as part of a closed-source offering;
- receive contractual terms (warranty, indemnification, support/SLA), subject to agreement.
